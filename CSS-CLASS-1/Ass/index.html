        <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
        <!--Poet'sName-->
        <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>

        <p>I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
            Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
            Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, <br>
            Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
            And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
            Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
            Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
            The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
            And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
            My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br>
            Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
            Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
            Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
            The lone and level sands stretch far away.” <br>
        </p>
